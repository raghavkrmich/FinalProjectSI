            <div id="txt1" class="gen_text" >Classic rock encompasses any rock music produced between the 1960s and 1980s.

            <img id="img2" src="img/classic_history.webp" alt="The History of Indian Music">
            <div id="txt2" class="gen_text">Though the exact origin is not necessarily defined, many believe that rock originated in the 1950s with artists such as Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. The genre became more popular in the 1970s, with artists such as the Kinks, the Who, and Black Sabbath. This music was more bluesy and jazzy. With the 1980s came hard rock, featuring bands like Metallica, Guns N’ Roses, and AC/DC. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the classic rock era ended.

            <div id="txt4" class="gen_text">Punk rock is known to be an aggressive form of rock music. This subcategory of rock began in the late 1970s. Punk rock is often associated with teen rebellion and alienation. The music sounds fast paced and loud, and features sarcastic and angry lyrics.

            <img id="img5" src="img/punk_history.jpeg" alt="The words the History of Latin Music">
            <div id="txt5" class="gen_text">This type of rock was generally found in the US and in the UK in the 1970s. At the time, the British economy was in a very bad state, so this gave rise to artists that wanted to rebel, and the punk rock genre was very fitting for such artists. Bands such as the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and the Slits are the more notable punk rock artists of this time.</div>

            <div id="txt7" class="gen_text">Alternative rock, sometimes called alt-rock, became popular in the 1990s, and covers a very wide range of rock.

Notable bands are The Cure, The Strokes, and Modest Mouse.</div>
